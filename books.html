<!-- <p> I am fond of autobiographies as they offer me a peek into an individual's thinking process and important life lessons that I can learn. I enjoy (or atleast plan to enjoy :p) books on world economics, geopolitcs, political history and science, self-improvement and any topic that tickles my thinking muscles. Sometimes, I end up reading a specific book to find answers to a bugging question that I might have.
