<h1>Books</h1>

<p> I have recently picked up the habit of reading books religiously. I am mostly fond of autobiographies since they give me a peek into an individual's thinking process and also because I am usually on the lookout for small (but effective) qualities and lessons that I can learn from others. Apart from autobiographies, I enjoy (or atleast plan to enjoy :p) books about world economics, geopolitcs, political history and science, self-improvement and any material that tickles my thinking muscles. Sometimes, I end up reading a specific book looking for answers to a bugging question that I might have.  Following is a snapshot of my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/85262689?shelf=">Goodreads</a> account.</p>
