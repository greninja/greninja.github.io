<!-- I finished my Masters (thesis) in Computer Science from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) (Vancouver). I was working with Prof. [Mathias Lecuyer](https://mathias.lecuyer.me/), as part of a Systems lab, fondly called [Systopia](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/). My Master's thesis was on the topic of adversarial robustness of machine learning models. Check more details here: [Paper](https://shadabs.com/research/2024/08/01/ars.html) and [Thesis](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0445441).

In a previous life, I completed my undergraduate (majoring in Computer Engineering) at University of Pune (India) from 2014 to 2018. During and after my undergraduate, I have worked on topics ranging from Systems Biology, Manifold learning, Privacy and Security of Machine Learning. I also contributed towards building a distributed and automated data science pipeline to synthesize images from a radio telescope.

I carried out these projects during my visits to *University of Waterloo* (with [Prof. Xi He](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~xihe/)), *National University of Singapore* (with [Prof. Reza Shokri](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~reza/)), *Tata Institute of Fundamental Research* (with [Prof. Hari Narayanan](https://www.tifr.res.in/~hariharan.narayanan/)) and *National Centre for Radio Astrophysics* (with [Dr. Yogesh Wadadekar](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/~yogesh/)). I have also worked remotely with [Prof. Baharan Mirzasoleiman](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~baharan/) on data poisoning defenses and attacks for machine learning algorithms. On these short journeys of mine, I have been incredibly fortunate to have had amazing intellectuals as my mentors and colleagues. -->


I recently completed my Master's in Computer Science at UBC, working with Mathias LÃ©cuyer in the Systopia lab. My Master's thesis was on the topic of adversarial robustness of machine learning models. Before that, I worked on ML security and privacy problems at University of Waterloo, National University of Singapore, and UCLA. On these short journeys of mine, I have been incredibly fortunate to have had amazing intellectuals as my mentors and colleagues.

I'm now looking to transition into more engineering-focused roles â€” specifically at early- to mid-stage startups where I can build scalable systems and solve ambiguous problems. To support this shift, I've been sharpening my engineering skills through side projects; you can find them on my [Projects](/projects.html) page or on my [GitHub](https://github.com/greninja).

I'm drawn to engineering cultures that value growth and impact, and Iâ€™m open to working across domains and roles as long as the product is compelling and the team is strong.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, lifting, biking or just about any form of physical activity ([Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/24538204)) and reading.
