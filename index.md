# About me

<img src="/assets/img/profile/Profile 2.jpg" align="right" width="250"/>
<!-- ![Shadab](/assets/img/profile.png)-->

I am a graduate student (research masters) in Computer Science at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) (Vancouver). I am working with Prof. [Mathias Lecuyer](https://mathias.lecuyer.me/), as part of [Systopia](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca/) lab. My masters thesis was on the topic of improving the adversarial robustness of deep learning models using key properties of Differential Privacy.

Formerly, I completed my undergraduate (majoring in Computer Engineering) at University of Pune (India) from 2014 to 2018. During and after my undergraduate, I have worked on topics ranging from Systems Biology, Manifold learning, Privacy and Security of Machine Learning. I also contributed towards building a distributed and automated data science pipeline to synthesize images from a radio telescope.

I carried out these projects during my visits to *University of Waterloo* (with [Prof. Xi He](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~xihe/)), *National University of Singapore* (with [Prof. Reza Shokri](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~reza/)), *Tata Institute of Fundamental Research* (with [Prof. Hari Narayanan](https://www.tifr.res.in/~hariharan.narayanan/)) and *National Centre for Radio Astrophysics* (with [Dr. Yogesh Wadadekar](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/~yogesh/)). I have also worked remotely with [Prof. Baharan Mirzasoleiman](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~baharan/) on data poisoning defenses and attacks for machine learning algorithms. On these short journeys of mine, I have been incredibly fortunate to have had amazing intellectuals as my mentors and colleagues.

Outside of research, I enjoy cycling and reading ([bookshelf](/books.html)).
