  <li>In my third year of undergraduate, I was part of a team that started TEDxPICT. This platform grew out of a small and informal discussion group. The goal, right from inception, was to host speakers from all walks of life and provide a global stage for such voices and, along the way, promote ‚Äúideas worth spreading‚Äù :) <br /><br />
As for my duties, I lead the production team for the event.<br />
