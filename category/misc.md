- In my third year of undergraduate, I was part of a team that started TEDxPICT. This platform grew out of a small and informal discussion group. The goal, right from inception, was to host speakers from all walks of life and provide a global stage for such voices. And along the way, promote "ideas worth spreading" :) As for my duties, I lead the production team for the event.<br>
